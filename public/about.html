<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michelle Park, a second-year student attending University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>I am an EECS (Electr. Eng. and Comp. Sci.) student, hoping to concentrate in computer science and dive into the software industry. </p>

<p>Outside of my major, I am interested in fashion and Korean culture, as I am part of the marketing team for Berkeley's FAST (fashion club) as well as KUNA (Korean club).</p>
